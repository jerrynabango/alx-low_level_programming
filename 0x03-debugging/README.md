debugging
# Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in the source code of any software. When software does not work as expected, computer programmers study the code to determine why any errors occurred.
There are many ways of debugging an issue. It depends on the problem. Majorly, debugging consists of 3 stages:

         * Understand in what scenarios the bug in a program is happening
         * Inspect the value of variables at different stages of a program
         * Figure out if a part of the code is executed or not.
